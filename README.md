# Trying out canvas
hopefully I add more tools to do.
Still playing around with the project structure and state management to find something that works well.

## Current Feature
  - draw rectangles and preview the shape while mouse is still down with 'r'
  - free form draw with 'f'
  - clear with 'c'

ya that's about if for now :(

This is just a for fun project to see what's up with <canvas />.
